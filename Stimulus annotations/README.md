## Stimulus annotations
In this folder, there are word annotations per story as well as POS annotations used to perform the POS analysis as an appendix.

wordinfo_nounRef_pos.csv: like "wordinfo_nounRef_new_v2.csv", the file contains annotations of word stimuli (i.e., pronouns and referents), their referents, timing, etc.. The only difference between the two files is that unfit words that were mistakenly included as target words were manually deleted for wordinfo_nounRef_pos.csv.
