This folder contains POS info of each word that occurs in the audiobook stimuli.

wordinfo_nounRef_pos.csv: this file is built based on wordinfo_nounRef_new_v2.csv (i.e., the stimulus annotation file). The only difference between the two files is that unfit words that were mistakenly included as target words were manually deleted for wordinfo_nounRef_pos.csv.
